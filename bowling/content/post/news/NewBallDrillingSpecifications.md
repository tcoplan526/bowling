<p>This year the new USBC ball drilling specifications go into effect.  Every hole in the ball now requires the bowler to have a finger or thumb in it.  No more balance holes and people who bowl without using their thumb cannot have a thumb hole.  Additionally, those who do not use a thumb must have a marker on the ball that indicates where the bowler's palm should be during the delivery.  The poster below explains this with images. </p>
