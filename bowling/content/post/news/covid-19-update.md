<p>Hello Bowlers.  We all hope you are doing well.  As things continue to reopen we are becoming more hopeful that we will be able to resume leagues this fall.  We still do not have any details in regards to unique restrictions or guidelines we will have to follow, if any.  As we all know, it is difficult to predict what conditions will be like two months from now.  If you have any questions or suggestions for the upcoming fall and winter leagues,<a href = "https://snhusbc.com/contact/"> click here</a> and fill out the form to reach out to us.  We do not have many details at this time, but we will try to assist you as best as we can.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.  We will post new information on the website as we get it.  We wish you all the best.</p>
